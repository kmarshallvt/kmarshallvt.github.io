	<p>wholesome meal kits to inspire greatness in the kitchen</p>
	
	<p>We curate, source and send nutrient dense pantry basics in a meal kit with 3-5 recipe options. Once you receive the kit, you choose which recipe option to try, and gather the fresh ingredients before going to town in the kitchen! Depending on how many you are cooking for, the meal kit will make 1-3 meals, allowing you to try the different recipes we send along. Our goal is to inspire joy and creativity in your kitchen by sending you meal kits that contain shelf stable pantry basics that are wholesome and nutrient dense. You decide when and how to make your meals and pick up the fresh items needed when it works for you.</p>
